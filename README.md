# CS162_P2_Zoo_Tycoon
A project focusing on classes and inheritance. Zoo tycoon is a game that allows players to run a zoo business. Different types of animals cost different prices, have different maintenance costs, and return a different profit at the end of each day. For this game, the player will be the proud owner of a virtual zoo that has spaces to house tigers, penguins and turtles.
